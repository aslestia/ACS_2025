**Learning Outcomes:**
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1. Apply statistical learning methods to analyze complex datasets from various disciplines.
2. Preprocess and visualize structured and unstructured data in Python or R.
3. Select and validate appropriate models for prediction and inference.
4. Interpret model outputs in a domain-specific context.
5. Deliver a complete, reproducible data science project from start to finish.
